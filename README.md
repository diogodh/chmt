## Protocols CHMT ##

> This website, as for now (2023), is being used to make protocols from my hospital (CHMT, Portugal) avaiable, and to have important documents and legislation. Later in the future, can become something different.

As for the actual protocol avaiable, it is a simple algorithm do guide someone through ROTEM test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboelastometry) in Trauma setting.

As for the legislation, it has useful information about CRI (Integrated Responsability Centers) of Portuguese National Heathcare System
