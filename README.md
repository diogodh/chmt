Protocolos CHMT

This website, as for now (2023) is being used to make protocols from my hospital (CHMT, Portugal) avaiable. Later in the future, can become something different.

As for the actual protocol avaiable, it is a simple algorithm do guide someone through ROTEM test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thromboelastometry) in Trauma setting.
